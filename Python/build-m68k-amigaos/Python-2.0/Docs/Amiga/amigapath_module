This  document describes the module `amigapath'.  This is the Amiga version
of  the  `posixpath' module which is used on Unix.  You should not directly
import this module!  Always use module `os' instead and then use os.path.

Functions in this module:

    abspath
    basename
    commonprefix
    dirname
    exists
    expanduser
    expandvars
(*) fullpath
    getatime
    getmtime
    getsize
(*) isabs
    isdir
    isfile
    islink
(*) ismount
    join
(*) normcase
(*) normpath
    samefile
    sameopenfile
    samestat
(*) split
(*) splitdrive
    splitext
(*) walk

For  documentation, see docs on posixpath module.  Functions marked (*) are
different from the ones in the posixpath module and are described below.


  fullpath
  ~~~~~~~~
New Amiga-only function.  Returns the full pathname of a file/directory
(i.e.  expands assigns).  Implemented in amiga module but don't use it
directly from there, always use os.path.fullpath.


  isabs
  ~~~~~
On the Amiga, a path is absolute when a ':' occurs in it.


  ismount
  ~~~~~~~
On the Amiga, a mount point is considered to be a device name.


  normcase
  ~~~~~~~~
On the Amiga, actually does convert the path to lowercase.


  normpath
  ~~~~~~~~
On  the Amiga, does nothing because x/y//z is different than x/y/z, because
a double slash (//) in a path means 'parent directory'.


  split
  ~~~~~
Split  a  path in head (everything up to the last '/' or ':') and tail (the
rest).  If the path ends in '/' or ':', tail will be empty.  If there is no
'/'  or  ':'  in  the path, head will be empty.  DIFFERENCE WITH posixpath:
only  ONE  trailing '/' will be stripped from head!  (on the Amiga a double
slash  means  "parent  dir"!   ) This means that if head ends in a '/', you
MUST  add  a  '/'  to it when reconstructing the path, or you will lose the
"parent  dir"  slash.   Functions  that  depend  on  this function are also
affected!  (basename, dirname)

  splitdrive
  ~~~~~~~~~~
Splits  a pathname into a drive specification and the rest of the path.  On
the Amiga this is useful (not on Unix).


  walk
  ~~~~
As  the  Amiga  doesn't  know  the  concept of '.' and '..' directories, no
exceptions are made for them.
