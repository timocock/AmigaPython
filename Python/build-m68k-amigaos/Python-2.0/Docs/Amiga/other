SELECT MODULE
-------------

The  Amiga  implementation of the select.select() function is improved.  It
now  takes  an  optional  5th argument, which is an AmigaDOS signal mask to
wait  on  (example:  4096 is ^C signal).  When the signal mask is not zero,
select  will  return  a 4-tuple (instead of the usual 3-tuple) in which the
4th  element is the signal mask of the signals that occured.  If no signals
occured  it  is  zero,  ofcourse.   Hint:  pass `None' for the 4th argument
(timeout  value)  if  you want no timeout but do want a signal mask.  Other
hint:  the `Dos' module contains a few constants for the often-used signals
^C..^F:  SIGBREAKF_CTRL_C..F.


TIME MODULE
-----------

The  sleep  function  will  use the select system call if bsdsocket.library
(AmiTCP)  is  available.   You will then be able to abort the sleep by a ^C
signal.   If  bsdsocket.library  is  not available, the regular dos.library
Delay function is used and you cannot abort the sleep.


TEMPFILE MODULE
---------------

The search path for a temporary directory is as follows:
	T:	(usually RAM:T)
	:T 	(a T directory in the root of the current device)
	SYS:T

If  the  global  (ENV:)  environment  variable  TMPDIR  is  set, it will be
considered first (before T:).  The paths are checked for correctness.
