dec. 1995 to dec 1996: version 1.3 releases. History stripped.

(1.3 is no longer supported)

12 jan. 1997	- 1st public release of version 1.4
		  Some minor additional changes since 1.3.
		  Includes doslib & ARexx support.

31 jan. 1998	- 2nd public release of version 1.4
		  Some minor changes. Included patches.
		  (version 1.5 is in beta).

(1.4 is no longer supported)


6 jun. 1998	- Release 1.5.1 build number 8
		  1st public release of version 1.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	*SOURCE:*
	- Major piece of work: based on new 1.5.1 sources


20 jun. 1998	- Release 1.5.1 build number 10
		  Patch release for 1.5.1 #8.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	- Fixes memory allocation bugs. 


14 nov. 1998	- Release 1.5.1 build number 14
		  2nd public release of version 1.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	- Import filename is now case sensitive.
	- amiga module now has crc32 function.
	- Dos/Doslib python module has more functions.
	- Revamped Workbench support. Now it is possible to provide
	  script arguments in the tooltypes, and better support for
	  data files with a Python icon.
	- Some minor changes and additions in the docs.
	- Changed email address and AmigaPython homepage.
		  
	*SOURCE:*
	- Added import filename case check in Python/import.c
	- Added crc32 function in amiga module.
	- Added various things to Dos/Doslib module:
	  GetProgramDir, GetProgramName, Inhibit, SetFileDate, SetOwner,
	  Info, AddBuffers, AssignAdd, AssignRemove, touch.
	- Added 'magic tooltypes' in Amiga/wbargs.c
	- Fixed exception handling bug in site-python/ARexx.py.
	- Fixed typo ('if'->'elif') in os.py.
	- Changed `doslib' to `Doslib' and `arexxll' to `ARexxll'.


13 dec. 1998	- Release 1.5.1 build number 15
		  Patch release for 1.5.1 #14.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	*SOURCE:*
	- Fixes message variables bug in arexxll.


28 apr. 1999	- Release 1.5.1 build number 18
		  (last 1.5.1 version - going to 1.5.2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	- Added I-Net225 version as a separate download (beta!)
	- Created lib/lib-dynload directory to help parse for 'exec_prefix' -
	  the warnings 'can't find... consider setting $PYTHONHOME' when
	  starting Python from a different location than Python: should be
	  mostly gone. (The small enhancements to the 'getfullpath' function
	  in the source code help too, see below).
	- time.strftime() is now more conforming, but it still doesn't pass
	  the test :-(

	*SOURCE:*
	- Moved a bunch of #defines to Include/config.h
	- Fixed nonfatal bugs in Modules/getpath.c (getfullpath and
	  calculate_path)
	- Enhanced getfullpath in Modules/getpath.c
	- Removed unused files from Amiga/
	- Added support for I-Net225 throughout the source tree.
	  (this involved changes to about 20 sourcefiles and a new SMAKEFILE
	  and SCOPTIONS). By using the correct SMAKEFILE and SCOPTIONS an
	  AmiTCP version or I-Net225 version can be build.
	- Added configuration options to the ARexx.py and arexxll modules:
	  setstringmsgs and settokenizeline.
	- Added 'Embed' demo on how to embed Python in your own programs.
	- Added strftime implementation in Amiga/ which is more conforming
	  to the standard than SAS/C's own version is. Sadly, it still
	  doesn't pass the test.test_strftime.
	- Now includes a demo on how to embed Python in your own programs.


30 apr. 1999	- Release 1.5.2 build number 1
		  First 1.5.2 release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	- Based on official 1.5.2 sources and library.

	*SOURCE:*
	- Switched to large data model (DATA=FARONLY). This makes the code
	  bigger & slower, but I can no longer compile AmigaPython with
	  the near data model (it has too much near data).


30 sep. 1999	- Release 1.5.2 build number 2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	- Prints correct string when command `exit' is issued at the prompt.
	- More missing 1.5.2 fixes (amiga module).
	- Finally the new time.strftime passes the test!

	*SOURCE:*
	- Fixed os.error exception (in amiga module; should have been a
	  OSError instance since 1.5.2).
	- Replaced the strftime code again. Now the code is taken from
	  GNU glibc 2.0.7 and passes the test in test.test_strftime.


[ build 3 omitted; that is SlimPython, the stripped version of AmigaPython ]

24 oct. 1999	- Release 1.5.2 build number 4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	- Fixed amiga.crc32 function to comply with CRC32 standards.
	  It now has an optional second parameter too: crc starting value.
	- Inet-225 is no longer supported. See the readme in the INET-225
	  directory for details.

	*SOURCE:*
	- Added fully network code free compile possibility.
	- Replaced amiga/crc32.asm with new version. Faster & compliant.
	- Removed I-Net support (SCOPTIONS and SMAKEFILE) because I don't
	  have a DATA=FAR version of Inet's link library.
	- Removed Modules/main.o from the modules.lib and made it a separate
	  link file. See next point.
	- Cleaned up the Embedding code in Embed. That required main.o to
	  be removed from the modules.lib link library and replacing it with
	  a smaller version for embedded applications.


4 oct. 2000	- Release 1.6 build number 1
		  First 1.6 release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	- Based on official 1.6 (non-beta) sources and library.
	- Full Unicode support implemented!

	*SOURCE:*
	- Applied the regular changes to make the source compile with SAS/C.
	- Implemented Dynamic unicode database loading in 'unicodedata' module
	  to save memory. Also the source can't be compiled with SAS/C so
	  another solution had to be found (I compiled it on a linux box and
	  transfered the unicode database to my Amiga).


28 oct. 2000	- Release 2.0 build number 1
		  First 2.0 release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	- Based on official 2.0 (non-beta) sources and library.
	- Full Unicode support implemented!
	- Includes fast Expat XML parser!

	*SOURCE:*
	- Applied the regular changes to make the source compile with SAS/C.
	  Thankfully the original source code is already ANSI-C now...
