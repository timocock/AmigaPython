This is a bogus file, but don't remove it!

It is needed for Python to find the path for the so-called platform
dependent libraries.  If this file doesn't exist, you'll get an error each
time Python starts:

Could not find platform dependent libraries <exec_prefix>
Consider setting $PYTHONHOME to <prefix>[:<exec_prefix>]


AmigaPython currently doesn't have any such platform dependent libraries.
So this is just a bogus file in a bogus directory.
