This subdirectory contains some Python demo programs.

For more programs, get the main Python archive and extract
it. It contains lots of examples (most of them don't work
on the Amiga but anyway).



classes/        Some examples of how to use classes.

metaclasses/    Python 1.5 metaclasses.

scripts/        Some useful Python scripts that can be put in your
		command path.  No optional built-in modules needed.
		Might need some changes on the Amiga.

socket/         Examples for the 'socket' builtin module.

world/		Print mappings between country names and DNS country codes.


ChatServer.py   Multi-user chat server, written by Irmen de Jong.
		The special thing is the mud-like interface.
