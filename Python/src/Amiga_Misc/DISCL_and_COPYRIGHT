("this program" = the Python executable in this distribution in
particular, but also all other files.)

I  tried  to  make this program error-free and safe to use, for your and my
own  benefit.   This  disclamer  applies  to the (small) part of the code I
wrote  myself.   The  disclamer  from  the  copyright notice from Stichting
Mathematisch  Centrum  (included  below)  applies  to the rest of the code,
written by Guido van Rossum and others.
  
I  provide  this program "as is".  USE THE PROGRAM AT YOUR OWN RISK.  In no
event will I be liable for damages to you - whether they arise from the use
of  this  program  or  the  inability to use it, whether they are direct or
consequential,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  the loss of data or the
generation of inaccurate data.  No warranties are made.
